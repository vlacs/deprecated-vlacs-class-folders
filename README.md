# vlacs-class-folders #

The purpose of this project is to automate the task of creating a folder structure on Google Drive and synchronizing
between teachers and students of each class appropriately.

## Implementation ##

The following will be implemented using Python.

* Create and share folders between teachers and students.
* Automatically add new students, teachers, and classes.
* Automatically archive student / class folders upon completion or drop.
* Initial batch to insert current students, teachers, and classes.

This program is intended to run on an internal VLACS server (linux) and will leverage the GData Python Client Library.
When it's finished it should be able to run anywhere python does.
