The purpose of this project is to automate the task of creating a folder structure on Google Drive and synchronizing
between teachers and students of each class appropriately.

## Implementation ##

The following will be implemented using Python.

* Create and share folders between teachers and students.
* Automatically add new students, teachers, and classes.
* Automatically archive student / class folders upon completion or drop.
* Initial batch to insert current students, teachers, and classes.

This system is meant to run on an internal VLACS server and will leverage the GData Python Client Library.
